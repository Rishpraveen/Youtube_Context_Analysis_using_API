## Performance Settings

- **Comment Batch Size**: Controls how many comments are processed at once (lower = less RAM)
- **Max Comments**: Limits total comments to analyze (lower = faster processing)
- **Chunk Size**: Size of transcript chunks for RAG (smaller = less memory usage)

## Language Settings

- **Fetch All Languages**: When enabled, fetches captions in all available languages
- **Preferred Languages**: Select languages in order of preference (when "Fetch All Languages" is disabled)
- **Auto-Generated Translations**: Include auto-translated captions (may be less accurate)

The extension can fetch auto-generated captions in multiple languages including:

- **Well-supported languages**: English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian
- **Indian languages**: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi, Urdu (‚ö†Ô∏è limited auto-caption support)
- **Other languages**: Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Hebrew, Persian (some with limited support)

### Language Support Notes

**Auto-Generated Caption Availability:**

- ‚úÖ **Full Support**: Popular languages like English, Spanish, French, etc. usually have auto-generated captions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Support**: Languages like Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and other regional languages may not have auto-generated captions available for most videos
- üìù **Manual Captions**: Some videos may have manually uploaded captions even when auto-generated ones aren't available

**When auto-generated captions aren't available:**

1. **Browser Player Extraction**: The extension can automatically extract captions directly from the YouTube player as a fallback
2. **Use Manual Transcript Mode**: Enable manual mode and paste the transcript yourself
3. **Check for Manual Captions**: Look for manually uploaded captions by the video creator
4. **Try Alternative Languages**: Use English or other available language captions
5. **Language Detection**: The extension will inform you which languages are available and which are missing

### Browser Player Caption Extraction

When the YouTube API doesn't have captions for certain languages (like Tamil), the extension can attempt to extract captions directly from the browser player:

- **Automatic Fallback**: Enabled by default, triggers when API extraction fails
- **Real-time Extraction**: Captures captions as they appear in the player
- **Multi-language Support**: Can extract multiple languages sequentially
- **Manual Control**: Can be disabled in settings if not desired

**How it works:**

1. Extension attempts YouTube API extraction first
2. If API fails for limited-support languages, browser extraction activates
3. Extension interacts with YouTube player controls to select languages
4. Captions are captured in real-time as the video plays
5. Results are formatted consistently with API-extracted captions

Multi-language analysis provides:

- **Combined transcript view** with all languages
- **Individual language tabs** for focused analysis
- **Language metadata** showing caption type (manual, auto-generated, auto-translated)
- **Missing language notifications** with helpful suggestions
- **Enhanced RAG analysis** using content from multiple languages

## Manual Mode

If automatic transcript extraction fails, you can enable Manual Mode in the options:

1. Go to extension options
2. Enable "Use Manual Mode"
3. Optionally paste a default transcript
4. When using the extension, you'll be prompted to paste the transcript manually

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+1**: Switch to Transcript tab
- **Ctrl+2**: Switch to Comments tab
- **Ctrl+3**: Switch to RAG Analysis tab
- **T**: Get transcript (when in Transcript tab)
- **C**: Analyze comments (when in Comments tab)
- **R**: Focus on RAG query input (when in RAG tab)

## Exporting Results

You can export results using the download buttons next to each analysis section:

- **Transcript**: Exports as a text file (.txt)
- **Comment Analysis**: Exports as an HTML report
- **RAG Analysis**: Exports as an HTML report

## Caching

The extension uses intelligent caching to improve performance:

- Transcripts are cached for 1 hour
- Analysis results are cached based on the selected API provider
- Cache is automatically cleaned to prevent excessive memory usage

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Chrome Extension APIs
- YouTube Data API v3
- OpenAI API
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Troubleshooting

- **API Keys Not Working**: Use the "Test API" buttons in options to verify your keys
- **High Memory Usage**: Reduce batch size and chunk size in the options
- **Transcript Extraction Fails**: Switch to manual mode and paste the transcript manually
- **Extension Closing**: Fixed in recent update - popup now stays open during operations
- **Slow Analysis**: Enable caching and consider using a more efficient API provider
- **YouTube Shorts Issues**: Extension now supports both standard videos and Shorts - make sure you're on a valid YouTube video or Short page
- **Video ID Not Detected**: Ensure you're on `youtube.com/watch?v=` or `youtube.com/shorts/` URLs
