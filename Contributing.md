// ‚úÖ Good
const extractVideoId = (url) => {
  const regex = /(?:youtube\.com\/watch\?v=|youtu\.be\/|youtube\.com\/shorts\/)([^&\n?#]+)/;
  const match = url.match(regex);
  return match ? match[1] : null;
};

// ‚ùå Bad
function a(b) {
  var c = /(?:youtube\.com\/watch\?v=|youtu\.be\/|youtube\.com\/shorts\/)([^&\n?#]+)/
  var d = b.match(c)
  return d ? d[1] : null
}
```
