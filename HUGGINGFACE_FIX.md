# Hugging Face API JSON Parse Error Fix

## Problem
The Hugging Face API testing was failing with the error:
```
Error: Unexpected token 'N', "Not Found" is not valid JSON
```

This occurred because:
1. The API was returning a "Not Found" response (likely HTML or plain text)
2. The code was attempting to parse it as JSON without checking the content type
3. The default model `microsoft/phi-2` might not be available or accessible

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed JSON Parsing in options.js
Updated `testHuggingfaceAPI()` function to:
- Check Content-Type header before parsing as JSON
- Handle both JSON and text responses gracefully
- Provide specific error messages for different HTTP status codes (404, 401, 429)
- Fall back to text parsing if JSON parsing fails

### 2. Fixed JSON Parsing in background.js
Updated `callHuggingFace()` function to:
- Use try-catch for JSON parsing
- Provide clear error messages when JSON parsing fails
- Handle non-JSON error responses properly

### 3. Updated Default Model
Changed default Hugging Face model from:
- `microsoft/phi-2` → `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`

DialoGPT-medium is more reliable and widely available for conversational tasks.

### 4. Updated UI
- Added DialoGPT-medium as the default selected option in options.html
- Kept other model options available for user choice

## Files Modified
- `options.js` - Fixed JSON parsing in API testing
- `background.js` - Fixed JSON parsing in API calls
- `options.html` - Updated default model selection

## Testing
The Hugging Face API testing should now:
1. Handle "Not Found" responses gracefully
2. Provide clear error messages for different failure types
3. Work with the more reliable DialoGPT-medium model
4. Parse both JSON and text responses correctly

## Expected Behavior
- If model is found: "Connection successful! ✓"
- If model not found: "Error: Model '[model_name]' not found. Check model name."
- If unauthorized: "Error: Invalid API key or unauthorized access."
- If rate limited: "Error: Rate limit exceeded. Try again later."
- If other error: Specific error message based on response

The fix should resolve the JSON parsing error and make Hugging Face API integration more robust.
